## Project Overview
NC News is a social news platform designed for sharing articles, rating content, and sparking conversation. Users can browse articles by topic, upvote or downvote posts, and leave comments — all powered by a fully functional API.

This project brought together everything I’ve learned about building a full CRUD front-end application.

Tech stack:
* React.js
* HTML/CSS
* Express server
* PostgreSQL (hosted via Render and Supabase)

The frontend integrates seamlessly with the RESTful backend I developed, which you can check out here: https://github.com/JC-Ellis/be-nc-news

## Key Learning Outcomes:

1. Structuring a React application — from planning state to designing components
2. Implementing features in a front-end application based on user stories
3. Fetching, displaying, and updating data from an external API
4. Implementing dynamic routing with React Router
5. Handling errors and displaying helpful feedback to users
6. Designing for user experience and accessibility
7. Applying clean, responsive styling
8. Deploying a production-ready front-end app
